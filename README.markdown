# RSpec Expectations

rspec-expectations adds `should` and `should_not` to every object and includes
Rspec::Matchers, a library of standard matchers.

rspec-expectations is currently in alpha release. While you are welcome to
track, fork, explore, etc, we're too early in the process to start fielding
pull requests and or issues from outside the core development team, so please
don't waste your time until this notice changes.

## Install

    [sudo] gem install rspec --prerelease

This will install rspec, rspec-core, rspec-expectations and rspec-mocks.
